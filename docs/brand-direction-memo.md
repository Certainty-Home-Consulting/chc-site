# CHC Brand Direction Memo (v0.2)

## Positioning
- Core line: **Clarity Before Commitment.**
- Offer: Independent advisory for homeowners planning **$10K+** renovations.
- Tone: calm, structured, neutral, confidence-building.
- Avoid: hype/sales pressure, aggressive contractor-bashing, busy visual noise.

## Visual System
- Primary navy: `#243447`
- Secondary slate: `#3E556B`
- Soft background: `#F5F7FA`
- Accent steel/silver: `#A7B3C2`
- Text dark: `#1F2933`
- CTA blue: `#2E6DA4`

## Typography
- Sans-serif, clean: Inter / system fallback.
- Weight hierarchy:
  - H1: 700
  - H2: 600
  - Body: 400/500
- Spacing > ornament. Prefer whitespace over decorative elements.

## Layout Rules
1. Hero = short, high confidence message + single primary CTA.
2. Problem section = structural risks, neutral language.
3. “What This Is” = explicit boundary-setting.
4. “How It Works” = 3 simple steps.
5. About = short credibility statement (8 years + why this exists).
6. Final CTA = minimal, centered, one action.

## CTA Behavior
- Primary action text: **Book a Beta Call** / **Schedule Advisory Call**.
- Keep one visual primary CTA style across page.
- For beta phase, include a small scarcity note (limited complimentary calls).

## Image Direction
- Hero image should be a clean house scene only (no baked text).
- Shield logo anchors trust/protection/verification.
- Headshot supports advisor credibility (not sales persona).
