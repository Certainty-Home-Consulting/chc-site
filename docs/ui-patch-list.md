# UI Patch List (v0.2)

## High Priority
1. Align section language with advisory structure:
   - Problem -> "Why Renovation Decisions Feel Risky"
   - What I Do -> "What This Is"
   - Add concise boundary text (not contracting work / not quote review)
2. Unify CTA labels:
   - Primary CTA copy should be consistent page-wide.
3. Add beta scarcity line under hero CTA.
4. Ensure hero composition keeps house, not overlaid text artifacts.

## Medium Priority
1. Tighten color system (navy/slate/silver) for stronger brand consistency.
2. Reduce red/green semantic colors that feel salesy/marketing-like.
3. Slightly increase whitespace between major sections.
4. Keep top-left dev version badge for local QA only.

## Low Priority
1. Move alternate hero files to archive after approval.
2. Add favicon based on shield logo.
3. Add subtle section divider rhythm for scanability.
